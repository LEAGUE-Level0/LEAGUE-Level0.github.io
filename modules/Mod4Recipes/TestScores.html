<h1>Test Scores</h1>

<p class="normal">
Write code to ask the user for their test score.<br><br>
Your program MUST allow the user to enter a test score that has a decimal, e.g. 75.5<br><br>
Give them a different message according to their score.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example: "Wow! You must have studied really hard for that test!"<br>
<br>

    <br>
    HINT: Think about how you would convert a String to an int and use SIMILAR code to convert their test score to a double.<br>
<br>
